## <p align=center> Lawrence's portfolio
<p align=center> I started this project way back when I was just started my programming journey and haven't payed much attention to it over the past 3 years and every once in a while I want to expand my knowledge on web development so occasionally I'll spend some time in improving this portfolio to showcase the milestones I've made in my life and build on my design to create a better experience for newcomers to view my portfolio.

### Progress so far
